Now let me create a comprehensive learning plan for your son. Based on my research of Processing tutorials and Java/Processing education approaches, I'll structure this as a step-by-step guide that balances your guidance with his independent learning.

## Learning Plan: Processing Animation Assignment

Given your Node.js background and your son's need to learn Java through Processing, this structured plan will help him build the required skills progressively while ensuring he understands each concept. Processing is Java-based but more beginner-friendly for graphics programming.

### Phase 1: Poster Selection and Concept Development (Day 1)

**Your Role:** Guide the selection process  
**His Tasks:**
1. Browse the NGA poster collection together and identify **3-5 posters** with clear visual elements
2. Discuss which elements could be animated (shapes, patterns, text, imagery)
3. Select one poster based on:
   - Clear geometric shapes or repeating patterns (easier to recreate)
   - Interesting motion possibilities (rotation, movement, interaction)
   - His personal interest level (motivation matters)

**Learning Outcome:** Understanding how to break down visual art into programmable components

**Your Discussion Questions:**
- "What shapes do you see? Circles, rectangles, lines?"
- "What could move in this poster? What could respond to mouse clicks?"
- "How would you describe this element's position, size, and color?"

---

### Phase 2: Processing Fundamentals (Days 2-3)

**Your Role:** Set up environment, explain concepts in Node.js terms  
**His Tasks:** Complete tutorials and exercises

#### Setup
Download Processing IDE from [processing.org](https://processing.org/download)[1][2]

#### Concept Mapping (Node.js → Processing/Java)
Help him understand Processing through your Node.js knowledge:

| Concept | Node.js | Processing/Java |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Variable declaration | `let x = 5;` | `int x = 5;`[3] |
| Function | `function draw() {}` | `void draw() {}`[1][2] |
| Object creation | `const obj = new Class()` | `Class obj = new Class();`[2] |
| Arrays | `let arr = [1,2,3]` | `int[] arr = {1,2,3};`[2] |
| Loops | `for(let i=0; i<10; i++)` | `for(int i=0; i<10; i++)`[1] |

#### Day 2: Basic Drawing & Variables
**His Learning Tasks:**
1. Create sketches using basic shapes: `ellipse()`, `rect()`, `line()`, `triangle()`[4]
2. Understand coordinate system (0,0 is top-left)[4]
3. Use variables for position: `int x = 50; ellipse(x, 100, 30, 30);`[3]
4. Practice: Draw 3 shapes from his poster using basic primitives

**Your Guidance:** Review his code together - ask "Why did you choose these coordinates?" "What happens if you change x?"

#### Day 3: Animation Basics & Conditionals
**His Learning Tasks:**
1. Understand `setup()` (runs once) vs `draw()` (loops continuously)[2][1]
2. Animate by changing variables: `x = x + 1;` or `x += 1;`[1][3]
3. Use `if` statements for boundaries:[3][1]
```java
if (x > width) {
  x = 0;
}
```
4. Practice: Make one poster element move across screen and wrap around

**Your Guidance:** Debug together if needed, but let him struggle first - learning happens through problem-solving

***

### Phase 3: Arrays and Loops (Day 4)

**Your Role:** Explain loops conceptually  
**His Tasks:** Implement repetition

**Learning Exercise:**
1. Create an array of positions: `int[] xPositions = {10, 50, 90, 130};`
2. Use `for` loop to draw multiple objects:[2]
```java
for (int i = 0; i < xPositions.length; i++) {
  ellipse(xPositions[i], 100, 20, 20);
}
```
3. Practice: If his poster has repeating elements (patterns, multiple shapes), recreate using arrays and loops

**Your Discussion:** "Why is this better than writing ellipse() 10 times?" Connect to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle from your Node.js experience

***

### Phase 4: Object-Oriented Programming (Days 5-6)

**Your Role:** This is crucial - explain OOP carefully  
**His Tasks:** Create his first class

**Day 5: Understanding Classes**
Connect to Node.js classes or objects he might have seen:[5][2]

**Concept Breakdown:**[6][2]
- **Class** = blueprint/template (like a cookie cutter)
- **Object** = instance of class (like individual cookies)
- **Constructor** = initialization function (like `setup()` but for objects)
- **Methods** = functions that belong to the class

**Simple Example to Study Together:**[2]
```java
class Ball {
  // Data (instance variables)
  float x, y;
  float speedX, speedY;
  float diameter;
  
  // Constructor (initializes object)
  Ball(float startX, float startY) {
    x = startX;
    y = startY;
    speedX = 2;
    speedY = 1.5;
    diameter = 30;
  }
  
  // Methods (functionality)
  void move() {
    x += speedX;
    y += speedY;
    
    if (x > width || x < 0) {
      speedX *= -1;
    }
    if (y > height || y < 0) {
      speedY *= -1;
    }
  }
  
  void display() {
    fill(255, 0, 0);
    ellipse(x, y, diameter, diameter);
  }
}

// In main sketch:
Ball myBall;

void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
  myBall = new Ball(200, 200);
}

void draw() {
  background(0);
  myBall.move();
  myBall.display();
}
```

**Day 6: Creating His Own Class**
**His Task:** Identify ONE element from his poster and create a class for it

**Your Guidance:**
- Help him identify what data his object needs (position, size, color, speed)
- What behaviors should it have? (move, display, bounce, rotate)
- Review his class structure but let him write the methods

**Your Questions:**
- "What properties does this element have?"
- "What should this object be able to do?"
- "How will you draw this in the display() method?"

***

### Phase 5: Event Handling (Day 7)

**His Tasks:** Add interactivity

**Mouse Events:**[1]
```java
void mousePressed() {
  // Code runs once when mouse clicked
}

void mouseDragged() {
  // Code runs while dragging
}

// Built-in variables: mouseX, mouseY
```

**Keyboard Events:**[1]
```java
void keyPressed() {
  if (key == ' ') {
    // Space bar pressed
  }
}
```

**Practice:** Add interaction to his animation (click to spawn objects, mouse position affects motion, key press changes behavior)

***

### Phase 6: Integration and Polish (Days 8-9)

**Your Role:** Code review partner  
**His Tasks:** Bring it all together

**Day 8: Combine All Elements**
1. Create multiple objects from his class using an array:[2]
```java
Ball[] balls = new Ball[10];

void setup() {
  for (int i = 0; i < balls.length; i++) {
    balls[i] = new Ball(random(width), random(height));
  }
}

void draw() {
  for (int i = 0; i < balls.length; i++) {
    balls[i].move();
    balls[i].display();
  }
}
```

2. Integrate all requirements: variables, arithmetic, shapes, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, objects, events

**Your Code Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Does it run without errors?
- [ ] Are variables named meaningfully? (not `x1`, `x2`, `x3` but `ballX`, `circleRadius`)
- [ ] Is code properly indented?
- [ ] Are methods broken into logical chunks?
- [ ] Does each class/method do ONE thing well?

**Day 9: Documentation and Header**
**His Tasks:**
1. Add header comment with:
   - His name
   - Poster URL, Accession Number, IRN
   - Explanation of which elements were animated
   
2. Add comments explaining:
   - Purpose of each class
   - What complex logic does (not obvious stuff like `x = x + 1`)
   - Why design decisions were made

**Comment Quality Discussion:**[2]
❌ Bad: `x++; // increment x`  
✓ Good: `x++; // Move circle rightward for horizontal scrolling effect`

***

### Phase 7: Testing and Refinement (Day 10)

**Together:**
1. Test all interactions
2. Check against rubric requirements
3. Verify clean code principles
4. Final polish

**His Final Check:**
- [ ] Animation relates to poster ✓
- [ ] Header with source information ✓
- [ ] Program runs ✓
- [ ] Uses variables and arithmetic ✓
- [ ] Uses multiple shapes ✓
- [ ] Uses conditionals ✓
- [ ] Uses loops ✓
- [ ] Uses event handling ✓
- [ ] Has custom functions ✓
- [ ] Uses arrays with iteration ✓
- [ ] Has self-defined class with objects ✓
- [ ] Clean, meaningful naming ✓
- [ ] Good comments ✓

## Teaching Tips for You as a Node.js Developer

**What to Do:**
- Draw parallels to JavaScript/Node.js concepts constantly
- Let him struggle with bugs for 15-20 minutes before helping
- Ask guiding questions rather than giving answers
- Review code together - make it a collaborative learning session
- Celebrate small wins (first animation, first class that works)

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't write code for him - type while he dictates
- Don't fix his bugs directly - help him debug
- Don't impose your "professional" standards too heavily - learning matters more than perfect code
- Don't skip the fundamentals to rush to OOP

**Recommended Pair Programming Approach:**
- He drives (types), you navigate (guide)
- Alternate: He explains what he wants to do, you ask clarifying questions
- When stuck: "What have you tried? What error message do you see? What does that error mean?"

## Resource Summary

**Official Processing Resources:**
- Processing.org tutorials[7][5][1][2]
- Processing reference documentation for syntax
- Example sketches in Processing IDE (File → Examples)

**Concepts He'll Master:**
1. Java syntax and type system
2. Animation loop thinking (`setup()` vs `draw()`)
3. Object-oriented programming fundamentals
4. Event-driven programming
5. Debugging and problem-solving
6. Clean code practices

This structured 10-day plan allows him to build skills incrementally while you provide expert guidance without doing the work for him. The key is helping him think like a programmer while he maintains ownership of the code and learning process.
